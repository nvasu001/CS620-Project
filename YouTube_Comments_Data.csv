L’Oreal Paris Infallible Fresh Wear Foundation In A Powder Foundation Review 1 Week Wear Test,Ask Candace,Amanda Nettles,Thank you for this review. I have extremely oily skin and drug store foundation just doesn&#39;t work for me. I used to use KVD tattoo foundation before they changed there formula and I lived it. Next I&#39;m going to try Estee Lauder double wear foundation. It is supposed to be the best on the market for oily skin.,1

L’Oreal Paris Infallible Fresh Wear Foundation In A Powder Foundation Review 1 Week Wear Test,Ask Candace,Seaglassmomma,"I love this stuff but you’re right, they need to expand the shade range.

L’Oreal Paris Infallible Fresh Wear Foundation In A Powder Foundation Review 1 Week Wear Test,Ask Candace,Miser's Makeup - Ng??i Hà Ti?n,"Thank you so much for your review, I was also very tempted b/c I love powder foundation, and this was so hyped up, and yes it’s also so overpriced it’s ridiculous. I knew I often cannot find a shade in L’Oreal foundations whether powder or liquid, so this is the final nail in that urge to try this one for me. Typically my best/favourite powder foundation sets itself nicely even without setting powder, if I only need about 3 hours of great wear for a quick errand/dining out, it’s the only thing I put on. Priming &amp; powdering will help my oily areas look more together for a whole day and yes I mean 24 hours. A bit of blotting every 3-4 hours will take the shine away and it’d look fresh again, with minimal transfer.",16

trying the VIRAL tiktok foundation... ?? L'Oreal Infallible 24 Hour Foundation Powder,Shaaanxo,The Lupus Lady Sick NOT Broken Beauty,"For my dry skin and clients, I mix glow drops or oil (depending on skin and SPF being used) in with the SPF! Then a dewy primer, using the sponge works or a brush if you&#39;re seeing it settle in areas. After concealing, bronze, blush, and so on... Set that face with a dewy fixing spray! Girl it&#39;s beautiful! For my oily clients, I use a gripping primer after SPF in those areas where they know they get crazy oily. Then I still use some type of fixing spray. It just melts in. <br>One thing I have noticed and love; cream and even liquid products jive with it! Rare for a powder foundation; but most work. I&#39;m just extra careful to see how high the oil content is in that product. <br>All in all I&#39;ve used this on everyone from brides to prom gals and it&#39;s quick so I pick it up for myself often. <br>Now I&#39;m trying a few other new ones. But so far I&#39;m very pleased with this one. <br>You be careful when you&#39;re eyes get that way! Could have very easily been a stye or pink eye. <br>Anything you used on or near that eye would need tossed if it can&#39;t be sanitized. Hopefully you&#39;re feeling better. <br>Next time try a warm compress a few times a day. If not better in two days or gets worse, go get it looked at. ??????",1

trying the VIRAL tiktok foundation... ?? L'Oreal Infallible 24 Hour Foundation Powder,Shaaanxo,Beverly Collins,Angie Schmidt at YouTube channel HotandFlashy used this and she said the same thing about covering pores and texture. She&#39;s 58. And she does not look her age because of the way she takes care of her skin with her Retin-A that she gets from Curology. She&#39;s also an Ambassador for Curology. You may remember her from her Good Morning America interview that she had a couple of weeks ago. She&#39;s also done interviews for Neutrogena with Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Garner if that helps anyone remember who she is. She is an absolute skincare perfectionist. She did a video a couple of weeks ago with pH test strips to show which products are trying to sell you a pretty container with mostly water in it and those who sell the actual product they claim it is with the correct pH level. The pH level of your skin care products really does matter. Her father is a chemist and developed a body wash that comes in plastic like the Tide laundry detergent that dissolves in the shower when you use the soap. If anyone is seriously interested in having better skin when you&#39;re Angie&#39;s age she is the best.,2

trying the VIRAL tiktok foundation... ?? L'Oreal Infallible 24 Hour Foundation Powder,Shaaanxo,OneCueT - Kristi,Any powder foundation clings to peach fuzz hair. The whole point of powder foundation is to be quick n easy. It&#39;s not quick or easy if I have to shave my face every time before using it. I tend to gravitate towards my liq foundations. I have dry skin so this type foundation looks cakey on me. A powder foundation is useful to add a quick little coverage. When its applied with a brush.

L’Oréal Fresh Wear POWDER foundation ?!

I&#39;m 58 years young and it does not settle into my smile or eye lines whatsoever! I use a brush to apply the foundation and the powder sponge, I press into my skin and the results are flawless. Most of the time, I only use the powder without the foundation and I have full coverage. Usually, I will use both when my skin feels a little dry (I live in Arizona) as the foundation acts like a moisturizer on my face, but 70% of the time, I only have to use the powder and it provides full, matte coverage and airbrushed finish! Take good care mija~<br><br><br><br> are time where I will only use the powder",0

I use it every morning/night and no more oily skin. Don’t believe any of those myths that you can’t use it with acids or retinol.,0

Like you say &quot;conceaLUR&quot; and the other beautubers (yeah I&#39;mma use this word every chance I get, sue me) &quot;concealer&quot;.

L’Oréal Fresh Wear POWDER foundation ?! Omg,KathleenLights,Candice Clark,I love powder foundation. I usually use the L’Oréal true match powder foundation. I find you have to prep your skin really well when using a powder foundation. And then using a setting spray after your done all your face makeup really helps the powder settle and not be as dry looking. Ever since I developed perioral dermatitis few years ago which thankful I was able to heal with a certain antibiotic I don’t wear liquid foundation anymore. I find my skin can breathe better with a powder foundation plus easier for me to remove completely. I learned that a lot of things can cause perioral dermatitis and liquid foundation is one of them. When I tell people I use just powder foundation they are amazed cause it doesn’t look like it’s a powder I’m using.,2
